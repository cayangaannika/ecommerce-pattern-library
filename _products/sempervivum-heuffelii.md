additional: |
  These evergreen monocarpic Sempervivums grow in beautiful, deep red clusters and have touches of green on the edges. Its thick leaves sustain it through long periods of drought.

  They are also deer resistant, so planting them beside other prized plants can help deter them from being eaten.
